							<br><H4>ABOUT PRODUCT</H4>
                        	<p>We created "The Student Select" that offers delightful reward donation user experience for college students. Each user can customize personalized interface as well as tailored donation portfolio. We wanted to make sure that entire user experience should enchanted for student users. We embodied the new feature of reward program onto preexisting personalized mobile banking system. Therefore, students can sign up for “We Donate Reward” program with one click.  The high-fidelity sample can be seen here.</p>


                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_Touchless.png" alt="" style="width:800px;">

                            <br><H4>MY CONTRIBUTION</H4>
                            <p>Mainly contributed in User Research, Quantitative and Qualitative Research, Stakeholder's Map & Personas Design, TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis, Seamless Information Architecture, and A/B Testing. I spearheaded the UX direction for two key project priorities: first, deprecate the pre-existing apps on the App Store and second, embodying the innovative feature into pre-existing user interface with a more efficient API system in order to create a consistent viewing/donating experience for PNC customers.</p>

                            <br> <br><H4>The Problem</H4>
                            <p>Student customers are not able to support local businesses with the current contactless payment option because most of local businesses accept traditional payment options: Cash and credit cards. PNC wants to improve the local business engagement.</p> 


                             <!-- <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/_____.png" alt="">

 							<br><H4>OPPORTUNITY</H4>
                            <p>"How might we encourage college students to support local businesses by PNC’s reward program?"</p> 

							<br><H4>FOCUS</H4>
                        	<p>Our team focuses on helping student users to support local business they do care and would support with their accumulated reward points. We pay extra attention on creating seamless experience for students while provide feeling of rewarding to help local businesses.</p>

                            <br><h4>PROCESS</h4>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_DoubleDiamond.png" alt=""style="width:1000px;>
                          
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_KeyProjectActivity.png" alt="">
                            <P>We first narrowed down our problem scope by conducting user interviews with students as well as through thorough secondary research. Through this, we were able to build out a user journey map of the process of a student spending money and identified some key pain points. During the stages of choosing the business and processing payments, students tended to have a hard time discovering or connecting with local businesses because most information traveled through word of mouth and it was difficult to know any personal stories of the local businesses. Students also found it hard to compare business options and their benefits, and would often just turn to the larger businesses that 55 seconds they were familiar with. Especially because students tended to value their convenience more than supporting a cause, they would easily give up on going through searching all the different rewards and comparing the local business options.<br>
                            Lastly, because many local businesses have limited payment methods (for example, many local places accept cash only), students had to inconveniently carry their wallets just in case when they were visiting a new local place.

                            <h4>LITERATURE REVIEW</h4>
                            <p>Our product development journey began from looking at the original problem statement at different perspectives.  Based on our primary market research, number of meetings, and a mentor session, the team rephrase the problem statement as an opportunity space. Our team was new to the commercial banking interface, so we began to understand the current interface first before we dive into conducting secondary research. Then, we conducted a literature review on 15 papers as well as numerous numbers of articles focusing on the following subject:<br>
                            <ul>
							<li>	Designing a social innovation in banking industry </li>
							<li>	Beyond mobile banking  </li>
							<li>	Community engagement  </li>
							<li>	Pains of local businesses  </li> 
							<li>	Gen-Z’s Payment Pattern  </li>
                            </ul>

							We conducted PESTLE(Politics, Economy, Social, Technology, Law, Environment)  factor analysis to see the problem in holistic view. Then, we synthesized our findings and design the high level of guideline of primary interview.

                            <h4> Literature Review </h4>

                             <p> Our team was entirely new to the field of accessibility, so we had decades of research to review. We split up accessibility over a few domains and studied the field over about a month.</p>

                             <p>We created a secondary research report for our clients, that synthesized the majority of our findings in our literature review. We wanted to go beyond dividing disabilities into the broad categories of visual, cognitive, auditory and motor. We found that there was overlap between those four categories and the solutions that exist. Instead we broke our research into conditions, limitations and solutions. An excerpt from our report can be seen below: </p>

                             <h4> Stakeholder Map </h4>
                             <p>Once we finish to draw an entire eco system and we then used Venn and Tree Diagrams to understand the interaction amongst stake holders and flow of value. It became clear that there are three major stake holders we want to focus on eco eco-system and their desire, feasibility, and viability. <br>

                            The service benefit should be:<br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>    Shared Economy Digital Hub</li>
                            <li>    Easy reward tracking & Redeem Function</li>
                            <li>    Emotional bondage between two key stake holders</li>
                        </ul><br>
                            Student can redeem their rewards for local businesses, make impact with the rewards given by PNC Student Select, Feel good to support local businesses.<br>
                            For Local businesses, they provide on-going contents, improve services with increased earning, and have easy access to their customer pools.<br>
                            For PNC, they can be a leader to support local businesses and student’s engagement in which helps to optimize local business while utilize small business experience data by providing<br>

                             <br><h4> INTERVIEWS AND CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY </h4>
                             <p>In order to better understand the student touchless payment experience and engagement with local businesses, we interviewed college students who are actively using contactless payment. We asked participants to explain what motivates them to use mobile payment, how they would contribute local business vitalization, and any challenges they have experienced.<br>
                             Through observation and review the interview notes, we could see where college students could make the biggest impact on supporting local businesses, where they feel short, and the support they need. We do contextual inquiry to learn what is important to users and PNC.<br>
                             Then we interviewed various college students, PNC’s college banking team, and a couple of local business. Primary research gave us a better understanding of PNC’s internal processes, mobile banking user flow, users payment process, and local businesses’ customer engagement via PNC mobile banking plat form.</p><br>


                             <h4> PERSONAS </h4>
                             <p>Based on the pain points that we decided to focus on, we created three personas in order to have a better idea of who and what needs our product would be serving. The three personas include Sonia (a busy student who wishes to support small businesses), Gabriel (an out-of-state new student who is unaware of local business options), and lastly Christie (a local business owner who wishes to expand her business). <br>To serve the different needs of these three personas, we decided that our product would be an all-in-one platform that would allow busy or unaware student users like Sonia and Gabriel to quickly discover and compare local business options, rewards, and payment methods. By serving as a platform that students can use to learn and choose a local business, it would also help the business owners like Christie to promote their business and its benefits.<br>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_Persona2.png" alt="" style="width:900px;">
                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_Persona3.png" alt="" style="width:900px;">

                             

                             <br><h4> BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY </h4>

                             <p> Market plan for students, so, to simplify, how are we going to promote the product to students? The team found that 75% of consumers plan to support small businesses more often. Also, 67% of consumers are more optimistic about shopping at local businesses. So, consumers already have the right attitude about supporting local businesses, and we’re just giving them a tool to help them do that. <br>

                             The best way that we feel will get the point across is through word of mouth, promotion in the app and the use of PNC university partnerships. WOM can be used when students are signing up for a student banking account in person at a branch or talking with a recruiter at their campus. Promotion in the app can be as simple as a pop-up window when the service is implemented in an update or notifications for when new rewards are available or expiring. When promoting the service, it’s important to explain why it is useful. Two talking points that could be reflected in the marketing strategy is the use of contactless payments and supporting local businesses. </p>

                             <h4> USER FLOW </h4>

                             <p> After we gained full confident on developing product development opportunity and the problem we would tackle, we identified the possible issues we could tackle, we mapped them on to the user flow.<br>

                             We focused on creating two user interface for student and local business users. Student experience seamless frontend interface while interacting with local business via PNC mobile banking. As for local business owners PNC’s backend workload could provide maximum value to add their profile with strong API support. The key feature was to smooth out reward point donation process and alerts system for reward donation opportunities.</p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_UserFlow.png" alt="" style="width:1000px;">


                             <br><h4> PROTO DEVELOPMENT AND USABILITY TESTING  </h4>
                             <p> Since our focus was on students and local business owners, connecting two stakeholders were a key feature we spent most of our energy during the proto typing process. We started by creating wire-framing and moved onto Low-Mid Fi proto sample for usability test. </p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_Development.png" alt="" style="width:1000px;"><br><br>

                             <p>From the multiple tests, we were able to see gaps we have to work on. During the test, we focused on user interaction and encourage them to think aloud. User pointed out two features they would add. One was filtering function and the other one was creating portfolio of reward donation. We took some time to brainstorm how we would want the user to interact with our next prototypes and applied our findings to develop a Hi-Fi proto sample.</p> 

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/PNC_filter.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"><br><br>


                             <h4> HI-FI PROTOTYPE AND FINAL DELIVERY </h4>

                             <p> Based on our insights from earlier prototyping sessions, we built a final proto sample. In our first round of testing with student users, we learned that they prefer using the iPhone interface because they have a better sense of space on it. After couple of iteration, we went through while adding features from usability test, we finalize to develop an enchanted API application for PNC. </p>

                            <p> <i>There are 30.2 million small businesses in the U.S. that are suffering due to unprecedented pandemic, but there are not many bank platform supporting them in a meaningful way. I hope our creation can make a positive movement to support local businesses.<br>
                            Overall, it was great experience to lead the team and present vision of the impact PNC would make for local community.</i></p>

                            <h4>Consideration</h4><p>The proto need to be continuously iterated on the high-fidelity prototype and validate user's needs through conducting user feedback sessions. </p>
                            <h4>Possibilities</h4><p>Once proto sample is approved, The team have to create mock-ups that better showcase our product for A/B testing.</p>
                            <h4>Challenges & Takeaways</h4><p>Creating a project in a short time has been challenging yet fruitful experience. I personally hope that PNC adopt this initials product development opportunity and bring "Student Select" to life.</p>
                            <h4>Next Step</h4><p></p>

            <h3> PESTLE FACTOR ANALYSIS </h3>

                <p> Starting with the secondary research, analysis of the PESTLE factors helped us understand the emerging trends and context of the problem area.   </p>

            <h3> STAKEHOLDER MAP </h3>

                <p> This activity includes our initial brainstorming of all the people who are affected by the project, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion.  </p>

            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ForwardCities_Stakeholder.png" alt="" style="width:700px;">

                 <p>We mapped out of the list in terms of power and interest, as well as plotting the information flow between these stakeholders.</p>

            <h3> Contextual Inquiry / User Interview  </h3>

                <p> The team conducted fieldwork throughout several phases. It began with interviewing residents at the local retail stores as well as the supporting organizations. Fieldwork pilots identified “communication channels”, “finding information” and “jobs” as key opportunity areas in New Kensington. During in-person interviews and directed storytelling, the team captured the core and subset activities in the key opportunity areas. </p>

            <h3> Insights (Affinity Diagram) </h3>
                <p> The research data were synthesized using affinity mapping to derive insights, identify target users and product opportunity gaps.<br>

                a. People who need social services are recommended by families or social workers before transitioning to workforce training.<br>
                b. Existing services information is diffuse.<br>
                c. Existing platforms are not designed to be underserved population friendly. <br>
                d. People who’ve been in desperate living condition feel:</li>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li> Frustrated trying to navigate new information</li>
                    <li> Overwhelmed by steps that they have to go through </li>
                    <li> They have a lack of supporting system</li>
                    <li> Hopeless and can easily give up when they face challenges</li>
                </ul>

                Therefore, it requires enormous courage to learn new skills for underserved populations. </p>

            <h3> Key User Journey: A life of Single Mom </h3>
            <p>The team synthesized all our data to draw a “User Journey Map” to clearly visualize the area for the MVP(Minimum Viable Product) opportunity.</p>

            <br><br><h3> Value Proposition Analysis  </h3>
            <p>We examined the value that would be created in the market and for the users by pursuing this opportunity. We used the Value Opportunity Analysis framework which helps us to understand the usable, useful, and desirable aspects of any product/service.<br>
            There are 7 classes of value opportunities that are discussed to determine the product/service. They are - emotion, aesthetics, identity, ergonomics, impact, core technology, and quality. Each of these is expanded in a total of 23 attributes which are defined and discussed.<br>
            The team defined each value from the perspective of the primary user group (low-income group) and focused on their goals, responsibilities to balance work-life, technology access, digital literacy, and habits. </p>

           <h3> Product Requirement  </h3>
           <p>After the VOA, we transformed the significant value opportunities into product requirements, and selected the 4 most important requirements as below:  <br>
            Once we justified our product requirement, we made a summary of our work to confirm the Product Development Opportunity as below: </p><br>

                     <ul>
                        <li> Guide low-income female residences (key stakeholders) to gain job competence skills.</li>
                        <li> Let key stakeholders build a self-curated network with social service supporting networks to reach financial independence.</li>
                        <li> Support discussions about resources with peers.</li>
                        <li> Design learning tools beyond text resources.</li>
                    </ul>
            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ForwardCities_ProductRequirement.png" alt="" style="width:500px;">
            
           <br><br><<h3> Ideation & Concepts Clustering  </h3>
           <p>In the ideation phase, the team brainstormed multiple concepts.  We used a variety of ideation methods such as: Crazy8, Rose-Thorn-Bud, and Reverse Assumptions. After concept clustering, the ideas were shortlisted to 4 preliminary concepts.  

           I break how to increase conversation rate into different phase: before onboarding – in progress –after progress. After talking with community leaders, we decided focus on onboarding process to connect users with supporting organizations.</p>

           <br><br><h3> Wire Framing </h3>
           <p>After we defined the features, action and related information, we began to sketch wireframing based on all our accumulated knowledge.</p>

          <br><h3> Reflection </h3>
                <h4>Consideration</h4><p>Because the web app stores personal data, we have a responsibility to protect user data and ensure that the data is being used ethically. This was a key concern from social benefit organizations because it is very important in forming trust between the supporting organizations and key stakeholders. </p>
                <h4>Possibilities</h4><p>As the population of single parents is increasing without no suitable education tools, KenNext is a great solution to fill this market gap. The product also can be expanded to other persona groups, such as chronic homeless, additics, and homebound parents.  </p>
                <h4>Challenges & Takeaways</h4><p>This remains to be one of the most impactful projects that I have worked on so far in my UX career.
I wish we could enhance the mentorship function, but because of the trust issues within the community, we decided to wait until they trust this new platform.  </p>

                            <p>The proposed product was to expand PNC's offering in the area of college student payment by offering an innovative credit card and a digital finance portfolio networking hub.</p>


                            <br><H4>The Project Overview</H4>
                            <p>The student focused platform does not exist although they have a great potential to be finance savvies upon graduation. Current holistic experience is not user friendly, so college students are having difficulties to fully understand the service benefit that PNC provides. A lot of them want to convert to other competitors' service because they provide a lot more college student focused virtual service, so they want to switch their account from PNC to other competitors. </p>

                            <br><H4>OPPORTUNITY</H4>
                            <p>"How might we enable college students to actively participate in their financial lives thereby making complex financial concepts accessible, useful, and delightful to them?"<br>
                            The current online banking system is uniformed for all clients regardless of their background.<br>

                            <br><H4>SOLUTION</H4>
                            PNC Student Executive program and its hub offers an innovative credit card and a digital networking hub where they can build their customized finance portfolio while interacting with their close network at the early stage of college life. A personal AI curator deliver daily briefing to college students and based on their interest. If students need more support, knowledgeable human bankers make virtual follow up appointment with them.</p>    

                            
                            <br><H4>The Impact I Made</H4>
                            <p>I was in charge of primary and secondary research and data analysis during the contextual research part. Later on, I backed our product proposal by providing robust data trend, unique advantages and learning experiences for client while aligning the vision of the impact the product would make.</p>

                            <br><H4>FOCUS</H4>
                            <p>Our team focuses on integrating technology that college tudents really needs. It is integrated into their daily lives with minimal effort, so they can stay on the top of their finance protfolio and already thihnk about future investment via a new innovative product.</p>

                            <br><h4>PROCESS</h4>
                            The overall goal of the project is to find solutions to help college students to design their financial portfolio with robus PNC's supporting hub. Throughout the process, we interviewed college students, internal college student department, parents, and bankers. Upon complition of viability of the product, I conducted a multiple rounds of testings to enhance user experience that I intended for users.

                            <br><h4>LITERATURE REVIEW</h4>
                           Our product development journey began from looking at the generation Z who are attending colleges. I reviewed conducted a literature review on 5 papers as well as numerous numbers of articles focusing on the following subject:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Digital Centric: The zen Z is smart and tech and digital savvy generations, who hold smartphones in one hand and are ready to spend with the same devices. They use smart phones to socialize with their peers via Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube. They use SNS platform to tweets, tags, posts, likes, and uploads their opinion. </li>
                            <li> Catching: G-Z exhibit very short attention span compare to baby boomer, Gen-X, and Millennial. To appeal to G-Z and hold their mind from fast scrolling, they need to see creative, meaningful, and simple messages. All new information should be delivered in fun and creative manners.</li>
                            <li> Interactive Communication: They communicate via SNS platforms with short video script, emoticons, memes, and gif files. G-Z likes photos, voting, stickers, sliders, quizzes, reviews, and comments. They like to be a part of communication instead of being recivers like prior generation.</li>

                            <li> User Generated Content(UGC): UGC is recognized as increasingly important to destination marketing for G-Z. They easily make decision on spending and investing when value is unique to them.</li> 
                        </ul>

                                        <p> Our team began to define the rooted causes of the problem before we move onto the research process. Then, the team analyzed the data supplied by Deloitte and dissected the problem: in our COVID-driven virtual world, how can universities increase student viewership of college football games?. We spent some time reframing the question and found ourselves asking how might we increase viewership by optimizing interactive experiences. The judges from Deloitte really liked how we reframed the problem statement because we embodied a human-centered design methodology to frame the problem.</p>

                                         <p>By reframing the opportunity, our team created a precise and narrow scope for our solution. The team focused on creating interactive opportunities, such as offer interactive game experience at home which users can enjoy more playful experience at-home to engage with games on stadiums. We defined key personas. We divided viewrs into two; Frequent Viewers and Non-Frequent Viewers. </p>

                                       <p> The team decided to use regression model for data analysis because it can be designed to identify both of two personas we defined. We envisioned to find a correlation between different factors that can drive the regression output. We first developed a boxplot to have information on the variability or dispersion of the data. It gave us a good indication of how the values in the data are spread out.</p>

                                         <p>The data analytic inspired us to create a real-time winner prediction game. Before the games begin the viewer can predict the game scores and main contributors to win the games. The game can be only played when it is on air in order to boost live viewership. If viewers can predict the game based on the live show with analytic report they can refer to predic a winner, it can be more fun than just watching games. By applying intuitive and clean UI/UX, we designed to make it easy for viewers who are new to the game prediction game.</p>
