						<h4 class="subtitle">My Contribution</h4>
						<p>I was a product owner in this project.  I guided a team of system developers while communicating with internal decision makers and external stakeholders to build an integrated technology solution. I mainly focused on developing a useful, usable, and desirable product that serves various stakeholders seamlessly while improving design service, product development, and production management work efficiently.</p>

						<div class="col-md-6">
						<h4 class="subtitle">Collaboration</h4>
						<p>This project is a collaborative project with a team of three information system students at Carnegie Mellon University. </p>
						</div>
						</div>


						<h4 class="subtitle">Solution</h4>
						<p>The fully integrated and customised Salesforce is running. Each stakeholder has immediate access to the platform. This gives the organization’s internal teams full control over their workforce service, provisions for apprentice training, and plenty of room for future iterations. </p>

						<h4 class="subtitle">Design Process</h4>
						<p>Considering the given time frame and scope of work, I decided to follow the agile development method. I thought the agile method would be a good approach as it accounts for related users’ input at incremental stages of the product development process. </p>

						<br><br><h4 class="subtitle">Product Development Objective</h4>

										<p>Setting the right scope was the biggest challenge for this project because it would guide  the user’s comprehension of the experience as well as strategic opportunities that might emerge for the program. In order to maximize the given time frame of developing a solution, I made sure to set goals that are clear, measurable and defined by a time frame. </p>

										<p><b>Then, I set measurable goals for this project</b><br>-See numerical impact of the program at glance, ideally on the first page after logging-in<br>
										- Oversee each project status as a simplified workflow<br>
										- Generate reports as different formats: MS Excel/Words, and PDF<br>
										- Communicate with workers and assign tasks via a solution <br>
										- Analysis of data to identify revenue streams and focus areas for service opportunities </p><br><br>



						<h4 class="subtitle">Put myself into Users' Shoes</h4>
						<p>In order to gain the holistic understanding of the problem space, the team reviewed<br>
											- the order history from 2017 up to 2019 <br>
											- literature of other nonprofit workforce programs and their innovations <br>
											- national data and trends for social enterprise financial success rates <br>
											- the finance history of the program. </p>

										<p>The Sew Forward program launched February 2017, providing technical education, access to professional machines, jobs, entrepreneurship training, and more, for exploring careers in the employment-diverse fields of sewing, tailoring and fashion design. In addition, the participants are taught soft skills, shown how to start a business, and how to use Etsy. </p>

										<p>Since the Sew Forward Program is the only mission-based design studio in West Pennsylvania that offers wholesome package design service, the program manager received a myriad of inquiries.  Although she was grateful to receive orders, she was overwhelmed with the amount of work. However, since Sew Forward is only the program generating revenue under the EECM umbrella, she wanted to utilize technology while generating a stable revenue stream to support the entire organization and the program while decreasing reliance on foundation support. To delve deeper into the problem space, multiple user interviews were conducted among different internal and external stakeholders.</p>

						<p>Since the goal of our project is to track the flow of service and production, we want the potential tool to provide access and insight into the project workflow, track finances, and automate the tracking and monitoring tasks that the program manager is doing to maintain and run the program. Additionally, the team wanted to create a standardized database to allow the key player to keep a detailed and consistent record of Sew Forward projects, clients, suppliers, employees, and purchase information for materials. This information is currently stored in several disconnected excel sheets rather than a standardized database, with only the program manager able to access and manipulate the data.</p>

						<h4 class="subtitle">Reflection </h4>
						<p>Integrating technology into social service is never easy. Developing a tool, generating a new service, or expanding impact requires an immense amount of hard work. Moreover, it's hard to convince internal and external decision-makers to invest in integrating technology into social service as people believe in the existence of a trade-off between social progress and declining economic efficiency. I began this project to prove the assumption was wrong.</p>

						<p>I saw myriad of missed opportunities to design even better systems while I was working for non-profit organizations because they failed to consider the capability of technology and the needs of all of the people experiencing in the community service. </p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<div class="title-image">
										<img src="img/works/SewForward_Present.png" alt="">
								</div>
							</div>
						</div><br>


						<p>There are many things I would have done when I was working as a product owner for this project.  I wish I was able to fully integrate financial reports, connect the platform to the overall EECM branding and invite more stakeholders at the earlier stage of this project. As a consequence, each stakeholder may feel that they also hold ownership of using the newly developed platform instead of being commanded by the system.  </p><br><br>
